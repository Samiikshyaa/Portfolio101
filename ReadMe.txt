Hello!
In my seventh semester, I worked on this project but still much more to update and improve.
This is a simple portfolio project, I have made using html, css and java. For validation of form, php is used.

Index.html contains the home page of the project. 
From "index.html" you can access different pages like my project detail, contact us page.
It in my project section, I have added time management app and detail about mona: the virtual assistant project that I made.
